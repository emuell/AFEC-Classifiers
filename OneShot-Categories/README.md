This is the `categories` model in AFEC, applied to classified _OneShots_ only.

# Percussive: 
  _short to mid short decaying sounds, mildly tonal -> mostly used to to create rhythms_

  * Kicks (_low frequency with a sharp transient: percussive hits & distorted kicks_)
  * Toms (_mid frequency percussive hits_)
  * Bongos & Congas (_mid to hight frequency percussive hits_)
  * Snares (_noisy mid to high percussive hits_)
  * Snips & Snaps (_short, dumb to noisy hit with two onsets/peaks and a fast decay_)
  * Claps (_non noisy mid to high percussive clicks and claps_)
  * Hats & Shakers (_short atonal metal hit noise or micro granular shaker alike sounds_)
  * Cymbals Rides (_long atonal decaying metal hit noise_)
  * Cymbals Crashes (_long atonal decaying metal hit noise_)
  * Metal Hits (_short hits on metal, including cowbells and agogos_)
  * Wood Hits (_short hits on Wood - hit by wood or metall_)
  * Vibraslap & Guiro (_short sequence of rattling on wood or metall_)
  * Viny Scratches (_short bent percussive viny scratches_)
  * Zaps & Blips (_non complex quick high to low or low to high frequency blips_)

# Tonal:
  _tonal, harmonic, simple to mid-complex sound -> mostly used to create tonal/melodic content_

  * Bass & LowKeys (_low freq, monotic base_) 
  * Leads & MidHiKeys (_mid to high freq, includes monotonic and polyphonic sounds or chords_) 
  * Pads & Textures (_long, mid to high freq - complex but still tonal_) 
  * Bleeps & HighKeys (_short, very high frequency or distorted blips_)
  * Stabs & Orch. Hits (_chordy, short and impulsive complex hits, yet tonal_) 
  * Triangles & Bell (_short to long, decaying hits on metal_)
  * Voice & Acapella (_spoken or sung words - riffs should be loops_)
  
# XFX:
  _noisy, airy, wildly, complex, atonal sounds -> mostly used to create non musical content_

  * Breaks & Smashes (_hit of metall or glass with following samller hits_)
  * Cracks & Rustle (_repeating, yet non rythmic crackling sounds_)
  * Nature & Athmospheric (_athmospheric sounds, mixed field recordings: non tonal textures_)
  * Explosions & Shots (_distant - decaying noise, roomy_)
  * Noise & Distortion (_any very badly distorted sounds, & pure noise floors_)
  * Whooshes & Whips (_quick to medium air whips or smooshing sounds_)
  * Sweeps & Lasers (_slow frequency or amplitude modulation sweeps_)

# Hidden:
  _avoids that loops or loops alike sounds are getting intgerpreted as some other OneShot categories_

  * None (_percussive or other somewhat rhythmic & complex content, often classified as loop_)
